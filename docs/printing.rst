Printing
========

The university uses a 'follow me' printing service where you can submit a print
job from your desktop and then print from any multi-function printer (MFD) on
the university network.

There are two default printer queues set up for this on your linux desktop which
you can use 'out of the box'. The queues are called ``mono`` and ``colour``. The 
first time you print to either of them you will be prompted to enter your
university username and password. Sadly owing to limitations in CUPS
(the Linux printing system) we cannot automatically authenticate you. Instead 
you can opt to save your username and password, and the password is stored
in your GNOME keyring (where it is encrypted).
