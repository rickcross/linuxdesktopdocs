Python is a popular and versatile programming language used in many scientific
disiplines across the university. It is by far the most popular language in use
by staff at Southampton and is the most used tool on Windows desktops too!

The university Linux desktop platform has a large number of Python 
implementations for you to choose from. We've worked hard to try to provide
