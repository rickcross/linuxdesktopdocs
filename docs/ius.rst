IUS
===

Inline with Upstream Stable
---------------------------

IUS is a repository of add-on software for Red Hat Enterprise Linux. It provides
up to date copies of important tools like Python, PHP and Git. Although it is
intended primarily for use on servers IUS provided packages for Python and PHP
offer the latest stable releases and are thus excellent for desktop users of
those programming languages too.

A complete list of IUS packages is `available here <https://rhel7w.soton.ac.uk/ius/repoview/>`_.
