GNOME Extensions
================

GNOME 3 features a unique extension system which allows you to install various
add on packages within GNOME. These extensions can be used to fix a lot of the
behaviour of GNOME 3 that many people do not like.

When you first login to a RHEL7 (Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 7) desktop 
you will be logged into 'GNOME Classic' which is GNOME 3 with a lot of extra
GNOME extensions. 

Finding and installing extensions
---------------------------------

Open the Firefox web browser and navigate to `extensions.gnome.org <https://extensions.gnome.org>`_

The website itself is used to find and install extensions.

Once installed you can open the ``GNOME Tweak Tool`` to configure extensions.
