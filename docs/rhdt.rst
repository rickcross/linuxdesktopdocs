Red Hat Developer Toolset
=========================

RHDT, or the Red Hat Developer Toolset, is a bundle of software for developing
applications. Bundles are released with new versions once per year and are
supported by Red Hat for two years. RHDT uses the :doc:`scl` system so that 
the tools are installed alongside and do not conflict with the base software
within Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

RHDT includes the following packages:

* GCC (C, C++, and Fortran)
* Eclipse IDE
* GDB
* binutils, elfutils
* strace and ltrace
* GNU make
* memstomp
* SystemTap
* valgrind
* Dyninst
* OProfile
