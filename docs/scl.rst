Software Collections
--------------------

Sofware collections - or SCL - is a collection of 'add-on' software packages
created and maintained by Red Hat. They were created in order to deliver
more up to date versions of software to customers on Red Hat Enterprise Linux
which typically does not update software "mid-life" of a product. Via SCL Red 
Hat is able to provide more recent stable versions of software for customers
to use without affecting the stability and security of the base product.

Due to our education licence all SCL software is available to users of our
linux desktops. More information about all the available packages can be found
on the dedicated `software collections website <https://www.softwarecollections.org/en/scls//>`_.
