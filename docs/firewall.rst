Firewall
========

From RHEL7 (Red Hat Enterprise Linux Version 7) onwards you can now manage the
firewall of your workstation provided you are a member of the ``sys`` users
group. See :doc:`permissions` for further information on groups.

The firewall is managed by the ``firewalld`` utility. To manage the firewall 
you need to start the graphical tool "Firewall Config". You can then use this
GUI tool to make changes.

Please only make changes to the firewall if absolutley necessary. The defaults
are probably all you need.
